File Access Policy Analyzer
---------------------------

This is a GUI tool to support the configuration and management of the
File Access Policy Daemon (fapolicyd).

fapolicyd dependency
--------------------

This application *can* run on pre-1.1 releases with some automatic feature
toggles, however the best user experience is to use 1.1 or greater.

syslog configuration
--------------------

To generate rules that can be analyzed from syslog we require the following
syslog_format configuration set in fapolicyd.conf

syslog_format = rule,dec,perm,uid,gid,pid,exe,:,path,ftype,trust
