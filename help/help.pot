From this integrator’s perspective, it appears to be a fairly complex subsystem with marginal documentation. Between local and remote execution scenarios, there are a number of variables: Filesystem permissions, X11 configuration (forwarding and authentication), and polkit configuration, and finally shell session environment."

"What is known: * A background daemon, polkitd is the ultimate arbiter for allowing/denying operations. * A DBus resident authentication service agent works to provide independent user authentication. I believe there are other IPC channels available for communicating with the polkitd however the vast majority of resources leverage the DBus. - Applications started from the Gnome Desktop can expect an existing dbus authentication agent to be running. - Remote ssh session applications can not assume an agent. Although pkexec is documented to invoke pkttyagent to serve that function, there appears to be a bug in some versions. * pkexec manipulates the runtime environment for security’s sake. This includes the DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY env vars, consequently executing GUI applications over ssh sessions (even those started with the -X and -Y) can require creative configurations. - pkexec env:\n"

Both local and remote ssh invocations ran correctly and as expected, consequently basic X11 forwarding via ssh -X is assumed good. * !Update!: The above statement regarding X11 forwarding not working for the fapolicy-analyzer still is true, however not 100% of the time. This anomaly extends to gnome GUI applications, and can be cleared by unsetting the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR environment variable. For instance xeyes exhibits correct DISPLAY forwarding, while gnome-calculator may or may not exhibit correct handling of the DISPLAY. unsetting the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR env var clears the issue immediately. Consequently the same observation holds true for the fapolicy-analyzer. At the time of the writing (9/20/21), I do not know the root cause. There is a noticable difference in the ssh debug information displayed (The ssh option -vv) between an X11 session with correct forwards and that of one with incorrect forwarding. I’m speculating that the auth1/cookie information may not be consistently maintained (or restored) when switching between standard ssh/X11 sessions, and those that transition to higher permissions."
